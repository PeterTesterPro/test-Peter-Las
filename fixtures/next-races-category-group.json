Well placed and should be in the finish. GIRO (6) ran below expectations last time at this track over 1230m, finishing seventh and beaten 6 lengths. Has the pace to settle in the leading division.

Must overcome a very wide draw but looks to be a tough type who shouldn't be in this grade for long. KADA (1) finished 8 metres from the winner in second at this track over 1700m last start at her first career run. Has the benefit of a good draw. Must raise the bar but a win is not out of the question. SEASIDE ROSE (2) was easily accounted for when seventh over 1609m at this track recently at her first race start. Strips fitter and can improve. LEO LINCOLN (9) is worth some thought despite his last-start sixth over 2200m at this track on June 29 and if the gaps come his way he can run into the money.",

GALAXY CAT (1) placed this grade at Belmont second-up quickly back to her best. Races forward and keeps the 2kg claim. A consistent galloper with claims. STORM LORD (6) is hard to catch but the near miss here two-back reads well. He will enjoy a soft run from the low barrier and the winkers are applied the first time.
