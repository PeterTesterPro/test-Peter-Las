I appreciated time it took me to accomplish this task. It was an opportunity for me to learn a couple of things.
This seemingly easy app had a couple of caveats that had to be tackled programatically, such as for example text format of countdowns, depending on how many seconds and minutes are displayed, or identical race times, which makes it difficult to assert on which position which race is displayed on the page.

One bug here that I've noticed but I couldn't reproduce was showing the countdown for the same race switching between positive and negative values.

After I've finished the task I've read in description that I should have been working in git repo so I'm pushing a fresh repository of "Cypress" directory for the review containing all the tests. Sorry about that. I hope it's not a most important aspect.
